# 🌐 Link Directory

A simple and lightweight web-based directory for collecting and organizing useful website links — with a special focus on **Dark Web** addresses.

## 🔍 About

This project serves as a curated collection of important and hard-to-find website links, especially those operating on the **dark web** (e.g., `.onion` addresses).  
It's designed as a clean, searchable directory that makes it easier to explore and organize these links in one place.

### ✨ Features
- 🧩 Categorized link display
- 🔍 Live search & filtering
- 🌗 Dark/light mode toggle
- 📁 Easy to contribute via GitHub

To **add your own link**, simply fork the repository and add your link to the `tar.json` file


We do **not host, endorse, or verify** the content of any linked `.onion` or clearnet websites. Use responsibly and at your own risk.

🛡️ Stay safe. Surf smart.
